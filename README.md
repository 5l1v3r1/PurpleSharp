# PurpleSharp
PurpleSharp is a C# adversary simulation tool that executes adversary techniques with the purpose of generating attack telemetry in monitored Windows environments. Detection engineering teams can leverage this telemetry to identify gaps in visibility as well as test the resilience, improve existing and build new detection analytics.
